/**
 * 设置 › 通用.
 *
 * The page holds exactly one preference, and it is this browser's: the
 * language never reaches the service, so there is nothing to read back and
 * nothing to save. Picking a language applies it immediately — the same
 * behaviour as `apps/web`, and the only one that lets the user judge the
 * choice without pressing anything else.
 *
 * The picker is the app's own list rather than a native `<select>`: this is
 * the setting that decides what every other label on the page says, and an
 * OS-drawn popup in the system's own type and colours reads as a piece of the
 * operating system that wandered in.
